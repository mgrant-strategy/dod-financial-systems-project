# DoD Financial Systems Project (Generalized)

## Overview
This project showcases a secure, AI-assisted financial tracking framework developed for a engineering initiative. While program-specific details are omitted due to security clearance, this repo demonstrates how I applied financial modeling, ERP integration, and systems design to enhance budget visibility and operational planning.

## Key Features
- ERP-driven Excel budget model for multi-million-dollar program oversight
- KPI tracking and compliance logic
- Designed AI workflows to automate formula generation, logic mapping, and system structuring
- Used generative AI to simulate testing conditions, user feedback, and reporting formats

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (advanced formulas, ERP data mapping)
- Prompt engineering for logic/system design
- KPI Dashboards
- Financial planning logic (e.g. ITD metrics, labor tracking, WBS rollups)

## Why It Matters
Some programs often suffer from fragmented financial systems and manual processes. This project introduced:
- Repeatable financial architecture
- Human-in-the-loop AI augmentation
- Better alignment between engineers and financial managers

## My Role
I led the financial systems architecture, aligned it with operational milestones, and integrated feedback from program stakeholders while respecting all data protocols.

## Future Directions
- Build a generic financial dashboard template from this model
- Apply LLMs to forecast budget usage based on historical ERP data
- Explore automation with Python for monthly reconciliation
